# Palindrom

> Palindrom is a library for two-way data binding between local and remote JSON models. It uses JSON-Patch for data updates and Operational Transformation for versioning and data consistency. It operates via HTTP or WebSocket or both.


### Usage

After DOM is ready, initialize with the constructor:

```js
/**
 * Defines a connection to a remote PATCH server, gives an object that is persistent between browser and server
 */
var palindrom = new Palindrom({remoteUrl: window.location.href});

// ..
// use palindrom.obj
palindrom.obj.someProperty = "new value";
```
* *Note 1: Please make sure you pass the correct PATCH server URL.*
* *Note 2: `palindrom.obj` is only available after `options.onStateReset` is called.*

most of the properties are accessible also in runtime:

#### Properties

```js
palindrom.property
```

* **_ Note 1: `palindrom.obj` becomes only available after `options.onStateReset` is called._**
* **_ Note 2: `palindrom.obj` is a constant (as in `const`) property, you can modify its properties but you can't assign it again or `delete` it. `palindrom.obj = {}` would throw an error._**


### Binding object once is ready (`onStateReset`)
To bind object where you need once it will be fetched from remote you can use define `onStateReset` in constructor:
```js
var palindrom = new Palindrom({remoteUrl: url, onStateReset: function (obj) {
  document.getElementById('test').model = obj;
}});
```

### Sending client changes to remote

Palindrom detects changes to the observed object synchronously. So after
```javascript
palindrom.obj.some="change";
```
The JSON Patch request will be send to the remote.

### Two-way data binding frameworks

Palindrom works superbly with frameworks that allow for two-way data binding, such as Polymer, React, Vue and Angular. These frameworks have the ability to bind an `<input>` element to a JavaScript data model in a way that the object updates after each keystroke. In consequence, Palindrom sends a patch the server after each keystroke.

If you want to opt-out from such behavior, you need to force your framework to update the data model after the element is unfocused (`blur` event). Depending on the framework:

- In Polymer 0.5 it is only possible with a Custom Element that extends the native `<input>`, similarly but not exactly how [`core-input`](https://github.com/Polymer/core-input/blob/master/core-input.html) is dome
- In Polymer 0.9+, use built-in `<input value="{{bindValue::blur}}">`
- In Angular 1.3+, use built-in `<input type="text" ng-model="name" ng-model-options="{updateOn: 'blur'}" />`

### Upgrading to WebSocket (`useWebSocket`)

You can upgrade the communication protocol to use WebSocket by setting `useWebSocket: true` option in Palindrom constructor or you can switch it at any moment by `palindrom.useWebSocket = true`.

WebSocket is a replacement for requests that would be sent using `HTTP PATCH` otherwise. The requests sent over `HTTP GET` (such as link clicks) are not affected.

:bulb: Note that this is an experimental implementation in which the WebSocket upgrade request URL taken from `X-Location` header of your first AJAX call response.

Sample:

```javascript
// enable it in constructor
var palindrom = new Palindrom({remoteUrl: url, useWebSocket: true});
// change it later via property
palindrom.useWebSocket = false;
```

### Heartbeat and reconnection

Palindrom will try to detect connection problems and then reconnect to server. If `pingIntervalS` is set it determines maximal time without network activity. When this time passes and no activity has been detected
Palindrom will issue a heartbeat patch (an empty patch, consisting only of version operations).

When connection problem is detected (e.g. there was no response to heartbeat or websocket has been closed) palindrom will schedule reconnection and trigger `onReconnectionCountdown` callback with number of milliseconds
to scheduled reconnection as argument, it will then trigger it every second. When countdown reaches 0 (callback is still called then) palindrom will try to reconnect (using `/reconnect` endpoint) to server. If this reconnection
fails then new reconnection will be scheduled for twice as many seconds (i.e. first it will occur after a seconds, then two seconds, then four, etc.). If reconnection succeeds, `onReconnectionEnd` callback will be triggered
and normal operations will continue.

For successful reconnection, palindrom sends a list of pending patches (those sent, but unconfirmed by server) to `/reconnect` endpoint and accepts a new state (along with version numbers) as a response. It then resets
to this new state and resumes its operations.
