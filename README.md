PuppetJs
========

Library for two-way data binding between local JSON view models and remote, using JSON-Patch, w/ optional OT, via HTTP or WebSocket.


Implements [Server communication](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/PuppetJs/wiki/Server-communication).

For additional binding with DOM, browser history, etc. use [PuppetDOM](#PuppetDOM).

### Installation

You can install it using [bower](http://bower.io/) `bower install PuppetJs` or just download from [github](https://github.com/PuppetJs/PuppetJs).

Then add source to your head:

```html

<!-- include PuppetJs with dependencies -->
<script src="bower_components/fast-json-patch/src/json-patch-duplex.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/PuppetJs/src/puppet.js"></script>
```
See [Dependencies section](https://github.com/PuppetJs/puppetjs#dependencies) for more details.

### Usage

After DOM is ready, initialize with the constructor:

```javascript
/**
 * Defines a connection to a remote PATCH server, gives an object that is persistent between browser and server
 */
var puppet = new Puppet();
// ..
// use puppet.obj
puppet.obj.someProperty = "new value";
```

### Demo

### Binding object once is ready (`callback`)
To bind object where you need once it will be fetched from remote you can use define `callback` in constructor:
```javascript
var puppet = new Puppet({callback: function (obj) {
  document.getElementById('test').model = obj;
}});
```

### Sending client changes to remote

PuppetJs detects changes to the observed object in real time. So after
```javascript
puppet.obj.some="change";
```
The JSON Patch request will be send to the remote.

### Two-way data binding frameworks

PuppetJs works superbly with with frameworks that allow for two-way data binding, such as Polymer and Angular. These frameworks have the ability to bind an `<input>` element to a JavaScript data model in a way that the object updates after each keystroke. In consequence, PuppetJs sends a patch the server after each keystroke.

If you want to opt-out from such behavior, you need to force your framework to update the data model after the element is unfocused (`blur` event). Depending on the framework:

- In Polymer 0.5 it is only possible with a Custom Element that extends the native `<input>`, similarly but not exactly how [`core-input`](https://github.com/Polymer/core-input/blob/master/core-input.html) is dome
- In Polymer 0.9+, use built-in `<input value="{{bindValue::blur}}">`
- In Angular 1.3+, use built-in `<input type="text" ng-model="name" ng-model-options="{updateOn: 'blur'}" />`

### Generating patches based on local changes

PuppetJs automatically observes local changes. This is implemented by dirty checking, triggered in event listeners for typical browser events (`mousedown`, `mouseup`, etc). It is done by the JSON-Patch library ([source](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch/blob/master/src/json-patch-duplex.ts#L352-L354)).

To generate patches for changes made in code, you need to either simulate a browser event (recommended):

```js
var clickEvent = document.createEvent('MouseEvents');
clickEvent.initEvent("mouseup", true, true);
window.dispatchEvent(clickEvent);
```

Or use a low level API exposed by the JSON-Patch library, provided that you have a reference the PuppetJs instance:

```js
jsonpatch.generate(puppet.observer);
```

Future versions of PuppetJs may contain a high level API for generating patches. Please follow the issue [#29](https://github.com/PuppetJs/PuppetJs/issues/29) to know more.

### Ignoring local changes (`ignoreAdd`)

If you want to create a property in the observed object that will remain local, there is an `ignoreAdd` option and property that
let's you disregard client-side "add" operations in the object using a regular expression. Sample usage:

```javascript
// in constructor
var puppet = new Puppet({obj: myObj, ignoreAdd: /\/_.+/});
// or via property
puppet.ignoreAdd = null;  //undefined or null means that all properties added on client will be sent to server
puppet.ignoreAdd = /./; //ignore all the "add" operations
puppet.ignoreAdd = /\/\$.+/; //ignore the "add" operations of properties that start with $
puppet.ignoreAdd = /\/_.+/; //ignore the "add" operations of properties that start with _
// .. later on any
myObj._somethingNew = 1; // will not be propagated to server
```

### Upgrading to WebSocket (`useWebSocket`)

You can upgrade the communication protocol to use WebSocket by setting `useWebSocket: true` option in Puppet constructor or you can switch it at any moment by `puppet.useWebSocket = true`.

WebSocket is a replacement for requests that would be sent using `HTTP PATCH` otherwise. The requests sent over `HTTP GET` (such as link clicks) are not affected.

:bulb: Note that this is an experimental implementation in which the WebSocket upgrade request URL is hardcoded (`__default/wsupgrade/<sessionID>`). In future, it will be replaced with a configurable URL.

Sample:

```javascript
// enable it in constructor
var puppet = new Puppet({useWebSocket: true});
// change it later via property
puppet.useWebSocket = false;
```

### Heartbeat and reconnection

Puppet will try to detect connection problems and then reconnect to server. If `pingIntervalS` is set it determines maximal time without network activity. When this time passes and no activity has been detected
Puppet will issue a heartbeat patch (an empty patch, consisting only of version operations).

When connection problem is detected (e.g. there was no response to heartbeat or websocket has been closed) puppet will schedule reconnection and trigger `onReconnectionCountdown` callback with number of milliseconds
to scheduled reconnection as argument, it will then trigger it every second. When countdown reaches 0 (callback is still called then) puppet will try to reconnect (using `/reconnect` endpoint) to server. If this reconnection
fails then new reconnection will be scheduled for twice as many seconds (i.e. first it will occur after a seconds, then two seconds, then four, etc.). If reconnection succeeds, `onReconnectionEnd` callback will be triggered
and normal operations will continue.

For successful reconnection, puppet sends a list of pending patches (those sent, but unconfirmed by server) to `/reconnect` endpoint and accepts a new state (along with version numbers) as a response. It then resets
to this new state and resumes its operations.

### Dependencies

PuppetJs is dependent on [Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch) to observe changes in local scope, generate patches to be sent to the server and apply changes received from the server.

It also, uses [URL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/url/), if your environment does not support it (IE, Node), you need to use shim, for example [Polymer/URL](https://github.com/Polymer/URL).
```shell
bower install Polymer/URL
```
```html
<script src="bower_components/url/url.js"></script>
```

### Development

#### Local installation of dependencies

In order to develop PuppetJs locally we suggest to use [polyserve](https://npmjs.com/polyserve) tool to handle bower paths gently.

1. Install the global NPM modules [bower](http://bower.io/) & [polyserve](https://npmjs.com/polyserve): `npm install -g bower polyserve`
2. Make a local clone of this repo: `git clone git@github.com:PuppetJs/PuppetJs.git`
3. Go to the directory: `cd PuppetJs`
4. Install the local dependencies: `bower install`
5. Start the development server: `polyserve -p 8000`
6. Open the demo: [http://localhost:8000/components/PuppetJs/lab/polymer/index.html](http://localhost:8000/components/PuppetJs/lab/polymer/index.html)
7. Open the test suite: [http://localhost:8000/components/PuppetJs/test/SpecRunner.html](http://localhost:8000/components/PuppetJs/test/SpecRunner.html)

#### Minifying

In order to minify it locally you'll need a basic setup.

* Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):

    ```sh
    $ [sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli
    ```

* Install local dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

* To minify project.

    ```sh
    $ grunt uglify
    ```

### Releases

To release new version run
```sh
grunt uglify bump

```

### Testing

Open `test/SpecRunner.html` in your web browser to run Jasmine test suite.

PuppetDOM
========

Extension to [PuppetJS](#PuppetJS) that adds DOM into two-way data binding chain (DOM ↔ local JSON ↔ remote JSON). Client side library that binds data on DOM level, so it integrates nicely with good old JavaScript, WebComponents, or Angular.

Implements [Server communication](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/PuppetJs/wiki/Server-communication).

### Installation

You can install it using [bower](http://bower.io/) `bower install PuppetJs` or just download from [github](https://github.com/PuppetJs/PuppetJs).

Then add source to your head:

```html
<!-- include PuppetJs + PuppetDOM with dependencies -->
<script src="bower_components/fast-json-patch/src/json-patch-duplex.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/PuppetJs/src/puppet.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/PuppetJs/src/puppet-dom.js"></script>
```

### Usage

After DOM is ready, initialize with the constructor:

```javascript
/**
 * Defines a connection to a remote PATCH server, gives an object that is persistent between browser and server
 */
var puppet = new PuppetDOM();
```
Now click, blur, pop/pushstate events may trigger a HTTP PATCH request.

### Demo

[Example with Polymer's Template Binding and Web Components](http://puppetjs.github.io/PuppetJs/lab/polymer/index.html)

### Options (`PuppetDOM()` constructor parameters)

PuppetDOM accepts the same option attributes as Puppet, plus the ones listed below. All the parameters are optional.

```javascript
var puppet = new PuppetDOM({attribute: value});
```

Attribute           | Type          | Default                | Description
---                 | ---           | ---                    | ---
`listenTo`          | *HTMLElement* | `document.body`        | DOM node, that indicates a root of subtree to listen to events.

most of them are accessible also in runtime:

#### Properties

```javascript
puppet.property
```
Property   | Type          | Default         | Description
---         | ---           | ---             | ---
`element`   | *HTMLElement* | `document.body` | See `listenTo` above
`listening` | *Boolean*     | `true`          | Is listening on

#### Methods

```javascript
puppet.method()
```
Attribute   | Type          | Description
---         | ---           | ---
`unlisten`  | *HTMLElement* | Stop listening to DOM events
`listen`    | *HTMLElement* | Start listening to DOM events

### Browser history

PuppetJs uses the HTML5 history API to update the URL in the browser address bar to reflect the new page. It also listens to a `popstate` event so it could ask the server for new JSON-Patch to morph the page back to previous state. Due to lack of native `pushstate` event you need to either:
 * call `puppet.changeState(url)` after your `history.pushState(url)`,
 * call `puppet.morph(url)` - that will call `pushState` and update puppet's state for you,
 * trigger `puppet-redirect-pushstate` with `{url: "/new/url"}` on `window` after your `history.pushState(url)`,
 * or use [`<puppet-redirect>`](https://github.com/PuppetJs/puppet-redirect) Custom Element that does it for you.

### Development

In order to minify it locally you'll need a basic setup.

* Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):

    ```sh
    $ [sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli
    ```

* Install local dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

* To minify project.
